You may also access this information through our vignette. First use this command for installation: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/datateachr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

vancouver_trees %>% filter(genus_name == "ACER") %>% 
  arrange(desc(diameter)) %>% head()
```

or find out the summary statistics of the data:

```{r vancouver_trees}
summary(vancouver_trees)
